On the admin side, I added features to\n    manage enrollments, control content access, and track student progress in real time. Admins could\n    easily see who had started, completed, or hadn't begun their lessons. Also, I fine-tuned the system\n    for better performance, making sure everything ran smoothly for both students and admins.",
